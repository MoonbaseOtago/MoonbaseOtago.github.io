title: VRoom! blog - quick note on a bug

### TLDR

After the past new work we went to spend some time just going over the core pipes
at the micro level lokking to make sure we hadn't broken anything - and found something
that's been broken since we rewrote the load/store unit.

Essentially the commit units are usually able to predict when an instruction will
be completed one clock ahead of when it will be available to be bypassed so we can
schedule subsequent dependent units for the next clock. Usually this is easy because
most instructions are of fixed length - but loads take a variable amount of time
and even though we know a clock before writing the loaded data back into the register file
we weren't signalling - this is fixed, it will be a difficult timing path.

Results - new Dhrystone numbers ~7.16 DMips/MHz - increased by ~6%


Next time: More misc extensions,
