### TLDR

After the past new work we went to spend some time just going over the core pipes
at the micro level looking to make sure we hadn't broken anything - and found something
that's been broken since we rewrote the load/store unit.

Essentially the commit units are usually able to predict when an instruction will
be completed one clock ahead of when its resulting data will be available to be bypassed so we can
schedule units dependant on that data for the next clock. Usually this is easy because
most instructions are of fixed length - but loads take a variable amount of time
and even though we know a clock before writing the loaded data back into the register file
we weren't signalling - this is now fixed, it will be a difficult timing path.

Results - new Dhrystone numbers ~7.16 DMips/MHz - increased by ~6%

Pulling another ~11% more performance out of the design warrants some more exploration in this area,
we know that for the above benchmark we're getting on average ~2.8 instructions retired per clock, but
the front end is decoding on average ~3.5 instructions per 16 byte bundle (per clock - 
Dhrystone is very 'branchy' so it's not really possible to write a faster decoder) - that means we
can estimate a potential top Dhrystone number of ~9 DMips/MHz, so we have about another 25% to find
in the execution side.

Off to work on some better pipeline visualization tooling, and to experiment with a 64 entry commit
queue (something intended for a real chip anyway).

Next time: More misc extensions
