        Branch Target Cache [BTC] (part 1) Predicting Multiple Branches per Clock
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">07 Oct 2021</span>

    <p>This is going to be the first of an occasional series of articles on the VRoom!/RVoom RISC-V 
CPU. I’m going to start with issues around the Branch Target Caches (BTC). Until recently our
BTC has been pretty broken - this was a good thing as it forced our core to exercise its 
partial pipeline shootdown logic a lot - experience tells us that this is where one finds the hardest bugs ….. Now
that it’s fixed and working let’s talk a bit about how it works.</p>

<h3 id="background">Background</h3>

<p>First some background - modern high end CPUs speculatively execute instructions across
conditional branches. To get high performance CPUs need to be able to correctly predict
a large proportion of branches - predicting a branch wrongly can cost 5-10 clocks (it’s actually worse in multi-issue 
CPUs like ours).</p>

<p>There’s a whole lot of research around the design of BTCs and predictors, we currently use a combined
predictor (see  McFarling’s “Combining Branch Predictors” [1]). It has a pair of different predictors:</p>
<ul>
  <li>the first is a binomial predictor, which tries to predict branches that mostly go one way, it uses a hash of the program counter
(PC) to index into a prediction table</li>
  <li>the second is a global history predictor, it uses a hash of the PC and
a history of recent branches to index a second prediction table, this is better for predicting
branches that have some contextual pattern, and</li>
  <li>finally a combined predictor uses a table indexed by a hash of 
the PC to predict which of the first two predictors is best for a particular branch.</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="/public/images/btc.svg" alt="placeholder" title="Branch Target Cache example" /></p>

<p>There’s nothing particularly special about using this design, these days it’s relatively conservative - McFarling
suggests it should predict 97% of branches correctly. We’ll talk more about how the tables are updated in the next
blog post.</p>

<h3 id="bundles-versus-instructions">Bundles versus instructions</h3>

<p>On a more traditional single instruction system
system prediction would be applied to every instruction in order.
Our system though is different - we decode up to 8 
instructions per clock - we read a 128 bit (16 byte) naturally aligned ‘decode-bundle’ on every clock.
In the RISC-V C-mode instruction set instructions can be 16 or 32-bit, and are aligned on 16-bit boundaries.
So each of our decode-bundles can contain from 4-8 instructions.
Depending on where we enter the bundle and whether a branch causes us to leave early we may actually
end up decoding between 1 and 8 instructions per clock.</p>

<p>There’s an architectural rule of thumb that (very!) roughly one instruction in five is a branch - this means that there’s a
pretty good chance that most of our bundles contain a branch - it also means that decoding bigger
bundles (more instructions per clock) may not give us a lot more performance, in fact our 4-8 may well be a sweet spot
for this sort of parallelism.</p>

<p>So for our system the thing that we are trying to predict is the behavior of decode-bundles rather
than that of individual instructions. It’s entirely possible that there is more that one branch instruction in
a decode-bundle in fact there could be up to 8 - luckily all we have to predict is the branch instruction
that’s the first branch that’s taken in each bundle, not every branch in the bundle.</p>

<p>For every decode-bundle that we’re currently reading from the icache we
want to predict:</p>

<ul>
  <li>if there’s a branch in the currently decode-bundle being fetched?</li>
  <li>what is the instruction’s offset within the bundle? (so we don’t decode subsequent instructions)</li>
  <li>will it be it taken?</li>
  <li>which decode-bundle to predict next - either a branch target or the next decode-bundle in memory.</li>
</ul>

<p>Our fetch/decode system looks like this (red lines are clock pipeline stages):</p>

<p><img src="/public/images/fetch.svg" alt="placeholder" title="Instruction fetch architecture" /></p>

<p>During every clock we use the PC to fetch a decode-bundle from the icache, we want to use this PC to predict the PC to
use in the next clock, but we won’t know anything about the contents of the data being fetched until one clock later
(during the instruction decode - between the lower two red lines in the diagram above).</p>

<p>Our instruction decoder is capable of doing some work to help us make sense of the instruction stream. It runs in two modes
starting from the instruction at the offset into the bundle given by the  fetch PC’s lower bits, what it does 
depends on whether the BTC gave us a prediction:</p>

<ul>
  <li>unpredicted mode - it stops decoding at the first unconditional or backwards jumping conditional branch</li>
  <li>predicted mode - with a bit mask containing one predicted branch bit it will stop at that offset if it’s
a branch, or it will stop at any earlier unconditional branch</li>
</ul>

<p>The decoders also return the branch destination for any non-indirect branch, and the offset (if any) of the 
branch that was taken</p>

<p>In unpredicted mode we can discover an initial prediction for a decode-bundle and enter it into the BTC, however
it takes 2 clocks (cache fetch and decode time) before we can choose the next decode-bundle - we depend on the BTC
to help us avoid this - we call this a ‘micro-prediction’ because a miss costs us a single clock rather than
5+ clocks that a missprediction resolved in an ALU costs.</p>

<p>At the end of a decode clock we can check whether the decoder’s branch destination matches the prediction we had made
a clock before of what the next decode-bundle’s address should be. If the PC address we’ve just fetched doesn’t match
the currently decoding bundle’s output we take a micro-prediction miss and refetch it. This can happen when a bundle
is first accessed, due to aliasing in the BTC, and if code is being changed in memory on the fly. We also check and update
the prediction of which instruction in the decode-bundle branched.</p>

<h3 id="global-history">Global History</h3>

<p>Our BTC uses a global history predictor - traditionally this contains a bitmask of the N most recent branches, whether they were taken or not - but
we’re not predicting instructions, we’re predicting decode-bundles.</p>

<p>Consider the following piece of code - it’s made up of 2 decode-bundles, it loops 50 times, taking the branch at
7a: on every second loop and finally taking the branch at 74: when it’s finished</p>

<pre>
p3:
  70:   03200513                li      a0,50		&lt;- bundle 1
  74:   c901                    beqz    a0,84 p3+0x14		
  76:   00157593                andi    a1,a0,1
  7a:   e199                    bnez    a1,80 p3+0x10
  7c:   157d                    addi    a0,a0,-1
  7e:   bfdd                    j       74 p3+0x4

  80:   157d                    addi    a0,a0,-1	&lt;- bundle 2
  82:   bfcd                    j       74 p3+0x4
  84:   8082                    ret
</pre>

<p>The first bundle contains 3 branches - no matter what happens one of those branches is taken every time around
the loop. As a source of global history “always branches” is pretty useless for creating a history
to predict which of the three to take next time. This is because it we need something in the global history
vector to help distinguish these different branches.</p>

<p>We need some information to tell us which of the two branches are taken each time we decode the first bundle (it’s
either the conditional one at 7a:, or the unconditional one at 7e: except at the end of the loop when it’s 74:) -
remember that the branch predictor predicts:</p>

<ul>
  <li>whether a branch is taken at all</li>
  <li>branch destination address</li>
  <li>branch offset with in its source bundle</li>
</ul>

<p>That last piece tells us which branch in the bundle to take.</p>

<p>Instead of just using 
a single bit of taken/not-taken history per branch instruction our implementation use 4 bits for each decode-bundle (a ‘taken’ bit and an index into the
bundle of the branch that was taken - that same “branch offset within its source bundle” that the 
branch predictor tries to predict) - this makes for largish history vectors but we can cheaply hash them into 
something smaller to match the sizes of the global tables.</p>

<h3 id="to-recap">To Recap</h3>

<p>The important ideas here:</p>

<ul>
  <li>we decode large bundles of many instructions every clock</li>
  <li>we predict bundles not instructions</li>
  <li>our BTC’s global history includes the bundle offsets of the sources of branches taken</li>
</ul>
